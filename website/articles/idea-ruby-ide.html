    <h1>We are talking about <span class='caps'>IDE</span></h1>
<p>The author has been using <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> as a Java <span class='caps'>IDE</span> for the past 4 years, and as Ruby <span class='caps'>IDE</span> for the past year.<br/>
The reason that the author chooses <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> ruby plug-in as the preferred <span class='caps'>IDE</span> for ruby development <br/>
is based on the criteria of a good <span class='caps'>IDE</span>, rather than that of a programming editor like <span class='caps'>VIM</span> or SciTe.  Agile software <br/>
development applies best to a project that requires good team work.  This is where a good editor <br/>
is not good enough.  Instead, the team needs a good &#8220;integrated development environment&#8221;, through<br/>
which developers can be as efficient as possible in their daily work of developing and coordination.</p>
<p>What is most important in deciding a good <span class='caps'>IDE</span> is to know that a feature comparison list is a poor way to do it.<br/>
To quote Alan Cooper, the author of the great book &#8220;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum&#8221;.</p>
It is abundantly clear to most of us that common folk don&#8217;t know the difference between
a token ring and a mood ring. We need these creator of &#8220;faster, stronger, better&#8221; innovations
to be sure that the creations actually improve our work and lives &#8212; not simply drive us crazy.
We need the technology to work in the same way average people think. We need a revolution to
restore our sanity.
<h1><span class='caps'>IDEA</span> as an superb <span class='caps'>IDE</span></h1>
<p><span class='caps'>IDEA</span> as an <span class='caps'>IDE</span> has surpassed its competitors due to its architecture design as well as its good <br/>
software product interaction design.  Here the author will pick several big areas to show how a good<br/>
<span class='caps'>IDE</span> can make Ruby programming easier.</p>
<h2>File operations</h2>
<p>You probably would think, &#8220;browse directory, open file, save file, revert file&#8230; what can be done better in this <br/>
area&#8221;.  Well, that is what the author thought before he started using <span class='caps'>IDEA</span>.</p>
<p>For starter, with large scale software development, the number of files has grown exponentially.  With <span class='caps'>IDEA</span>,<br/>
you can open any file by just typing the file name, and <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> will find it in the project directory.</p>
<p><span class='caps'>IDEA</span> has this very good feature called local history.  As you editing the files, <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> records the history of them.  At<br/>
the same time, <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> tags this history based on the significant operations that you perform.  If you want to find<br/>
out what the changes are since the last time you had all the tests pass, or opened the project, you can with <span class='caps'>IDEA</span>.<br/>
And you can compare the file content, down to the lines and characters.  With the local history, there is less and less<br/>
reason to keep file modified without saving it, or have a long list of file open at the same time.  So <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> became the<br/>
first product and the only <span class='caps'>IDE</span> that finally saved the user from the idea of &#8220;save a file&#8221;, because they are saved automatically.<br/>
The old tabs can also be closed automatically so that the <span class='caps'>IDE</span> does not get cluttered.</p>
<h2><span class='caps'>VCS</span> support</h2>
<p>With an excellent file comparison dialog, IDEA&#8217;s version control system (<span class='caps'>VCS</span>) support is also almost perfect.  The<br/>
recommended practice in a team environment is to update the source, make sure all tests pass, before check in<br/>
the changes that you have made.  All these actions are at the top menus in <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> and have default key maps.</p>
<p>With <span class='caps'>IDEA</span>, you can also create and apply patches, an artifacts used most commonly in open source community.  <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> also allows you<br/>
to &#8220;Shelve&#8221; changes (temporarily remove from code and save as patch, then restore later).  You can also move certain changes to <br/>
different change list, a unique feature that was only available to the customer of Perforce, one of the few successful commercial<br/>
version control system.</p>
<h2>Plug-in Support</h2>
<p><span class='caps'>IDEA</span> took a minimalist&#8217;s approach when it comes to plug-in development, which made it very easy to write or install plug-in&#8217;s <br/>
to extend its functionality even further.  You specify everything in a <code>plug.xml</code> file.  The plug-in is packaged as <span class='caps'>ONE</span> <span class='caps'>SINGLE</span> jar<br/>
file.  The <span class='caps'>API</span> of the plug-in framework is also well documented and very easy to use.  As a matter of fact, the ruby plug-in that <br/>
JetBrain is developing right now is not the first ruby plug-in that has been built.</p>
<h1>IDEA&#8217;s adequate Ruby support</h1>
<p>Because of IDEA&#8217;s powerful <span class='caps'>IDE</span> features, its Ruby support only needs to be adequate to put itself on top of the Ruby <span class='caps'>IDE</span> list.</p>
<h2>Ruby as a Language</h2>
<p><span class='caps'>IDEA</span> understands enough about the Ruby to give you a decent syntax highlighting, error highlighting support.  You can also open any<br/>
Ruby class just by typing the class name, and go to any member of a class by typing its name.  If you have class specifications in rspec,<br/>
you can open them up by just typing the file name. (<a href='http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/download/attachments/23722/ruby21_.png'>Snapshot</a>).</p>
<p>With IDEA&#8217;s runtime support and Ruby&#8217;s script language nature, running any script is just one keystroke away (Ctrl+Shift+F10).  This flexibility, <br/>
the &#8220;re-run last configuration&#8221; feature, and the ability to click on the exception stack in the output pane made it very easy to do test-driven <br/>
development with Ruby unit, or behavior-driven development with rSpec.</p>
<h2>Explore Ruby with RDoc</h2>
<p><span class='caps'>IDEA</span> has integrated RI and RDoc support, which is what most Ruby developers used to learn about different classes in Ruby.  It behaves pretty <br/>
much like the fxri that came with Ruby one-click installer.  You just need to type the class name and method name to see the RDoc <br/>
associated with them.</p>
<h2>Rails Support</h2>
<p>Even though the RoR developers that the author knows of indicated that due to the nature of Ruby, it is enough as long as you have a good <span class='caps'>IDE</span><br/>
support and use command line for Rails related work.  Nevertheless, you can still run the generation script, add new actions and launch<br/>
the servers</p>
<h1>Future of IDEA&#8217;s Ruby support</h1>
<p>At the moment, <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> is falling a bit behind on the advanced Ruby support like refactoring and code completion.  <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> was rather late in developing<br/>
its JUnit support.  Hopefully this time they will be the first.</p>
<p>As <span class='caps'>IDEA</span> is working on releasing Selena, the latest version with even better design and more useful features, Ruby plug-in is also under heavy<br/>
development on this platform.  You can download Selena through the JetBrain <span class='caps'>EAP</span> program, and install the Ruby plug-in through the install manager.</p>
<p>As an extremely satisfied Java developer with <span class='caps'>IDEA</span>, looking at their <br/>
<a href='http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/RUBYDEV/Development+Roadmap'>Development Roadmap</a>, the author has nothing but confidence that<br/>
<span class='caps'>IDEA</span> Ruby support will only be better and better.  That could end up being a false statement, but for the moment, that is where the money is.</p>
