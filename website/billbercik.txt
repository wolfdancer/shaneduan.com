h1. Bill Bercik

Bill is a good friend that I got to know during my work at Borland in Scotts Valley.  It is really hard to describe the kind of person that he is in a short paragraph, or even by one person.  But I'll try with the following memories:

h2. Experiences that I Enjoyed with Bill

# Beer ride to Chico, CA, starting with beers on the Amtrak, followed by beers all around Chico (with Chicken fried steak as breakfast, lunch and dinner), finished by renting a car all the way back to Santa Cruz because we both passed out and missed the train back.
# White water rafting in American River, with Bill driving both ways.  We both spent the nex month peeling skins.
# Beer tossing.
# Various beer and special food parties
# Being the beta tester of his business ""webpasties":http://www.webpasties.com"
# Being the customer of him business

h2. Experiences that I should Have Had

# Buy him a beer after I left Borland
# Met with him and catch up after I got back from China
# Bar Hopping on Capitola
# Bike riding
# Visiting him at Costa Rica
# Exotic meat party (No idea why I missed that one)
