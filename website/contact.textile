----------------------------------------------------

I live around bay area and I am involved in "local communities":community.html.  Please feel free to drop me a line, especially if you think you can help on the following area:

h1. Open Source Contribution

* Have thoughts on build and release projects and how "BuildMaster":http://buildmaster.rubyforge.org can help on this area.
* Can help on one of my other "open source projects":opensource.html.

h1. Local Community Service

I am planning on getting more involved with local education system, by offering my service as a teacher in software engineer area, under two conditions:

* It needs to be directly related to agile software development
* All proceeds go to a local charity with good reputation.  I would gladly take suggestions but should have the authority to decide which one it should be.

If you don't see the contact form below, that means the service I am using is still down.  You can find my contact through BayXP mailing list.
