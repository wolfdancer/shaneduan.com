Welcome!  This site is divided into the three major sections.  Hope you enjoy it.

I produce or help produce better software faster for a living, and enjoy hiking, snowboarding, traveling, as well as computer games and board games.

This website is made available by "BuildMaster":http://buildmaster.rubyforge.org, an opensource project that I started that finally
