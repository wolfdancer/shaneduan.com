Wedding
-----------------------------------------------------------
After a month-long search, I finally decided on the beach of "Aptos, California":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptos%2C_California.
We rented a house that is right on the sand, and hosted the wedding in the backyard in front of the beach.

It turned out to be a very lovely day.
